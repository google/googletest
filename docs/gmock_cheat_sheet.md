## Defining a Mock Class

### Mocking a Normal Class {#MockClass}

Given

```cpp
class Foo {
 public:
  virtual ~Foo();
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual string Describe(const char* name) = 0;
  virtual string Describe(int type) = 0;
  virtual bool Process(Bar elem, int count) = 0;
};
```

(note that `~Foo()` **must** be virtual) we can define its mock as

```cpp
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MockFoo : public Foo {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(string, Describe, (const char* name), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(string, Describe, (int type), (override));
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Process, (Bar elem, int count), (override));
};
```

To create a "nice" mock, which ignores all uninteresting calls, a "naggy" mock,
which warns on all uninteresting calls, or a "strict" mock, which treats them as
failures:

```cpp
using ::testing::NiceMock;
using ::testing::NaggyMock;
using ::testing::StrictMock;

NiceMock<MockFoo> nice_foo;      // The type is a subclass of MockFoo.
NaggyMock<MockFoo> naggy_foo;    // The type is a subclass of MockFoo.
StrictMock<MockFoo> strict_foo;  // The type is a subclass of MockFoo.
```

{: .callout .note}
**Note:** A mock object is currently naggy by default. We may make it nice by
default in the future.

### Mocking a Class Template {#MockTemplate}

Class templates can be mocked just like any class.

To mock

```cpp
template <typename Elem>
class StackInterface {
 public:
  virtual ~StackInterface();
  virtual int GetSize() const = 0;
  virtual void Push(const Elem& x) = 0;
};
```

(note that all member functions that are mocked, including `~StackInterface()`
**must** be virtual).

```cpp
template <typename Elem>
class MockStack : public StackInterface<Elem> {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(int, GetSize, (), (const, override));
  MOCK_METHOD(void, Push, (const Elem& x), (override));
};
```

### Specifying Calling Conventions for Mock Functions

If your mock function doesn't use the default calling convention, you can
specify it by adding `Calltype(convention)` to `MOCK_METHOD`'s 4th parameter.
For example,

```cpp
  MOCK_METHOD(bool, Foo, (int n), (Calltype(STDMETHODCALLTYPE)));
  MOCK_METHOD(int, Bar, (double x, double y),
              (const, Calltype(STDMETHODCALLTYPE)));
```

where `STDMETHODCALLTYPE` is defined by `<objbase.h>` on Windows.

## Using Mocks in Tests {#UsingMocks}

The typical work flow is:

1.  Import the gMock names you need to use. All gMock symbols are in the
    `testing` namespace unless they are macros or otherwise noted.
2.  Create the mock objects.
3.  Optionally, set the default actions of the mock objects.
4.  Set your expectations on the mock objects (How will they be called? What
    will they do?).
5.  Exercise code that uses the mock objects; if necessary, check the result
    using googletest assertions.
6.  When a mock object is destructed, gMock automatically verifies that all
    expectations on it have been satisfied.

Here's an example:

```cpp
using ::testing::Return;                          // #1

TEST(BarTest, DoesThis) {
  MockFoo foo;                                    // #2

  ON_CALL(foo, GetSize())                         // #3
      .WillByDefault(Return(1));
  // ... other default actions ...

  EXPECT_CALL(foo, Describe(5))                   // #4
      .Times(3)
      .WillRepeatedly(Return("Category 5"));
  // ... other expectations ...

  EXPECT_EQ(MyProductionFunction(&foo), "good");  // #5
}                                                 // #6
```

## Setting Default Actions {#OnCall}

gMock has a **built-in default action** for any function that returns `void`,
`bool`, a numeric value, or a pointer. In C++11, it additionally returns
the default-constructed value, if one exists for the given type.

To customize the default action for functions with return type `T`, use
[`DefaultValue<T>`](reference/mocking.md#DefaultValue). For example:

```cpp
  // Sets the default action for return type std::unique_ptr<Buzz> to
  // creating a new Buzz every time.
  DefaultValue<std::unique_ptr<Buzz>>::SetFactory(
      [] { return std::make_unique<Buzz>(AccessLevel::kInternal); });

  // When this fires, the default action of MakeBuzz() will run, which
  // will return a new Buzz object.
  EXPECT_CALL(mock_buzzer_, MakeBuzz("hello")).Times(AnyNumber());

  auto buzz1 = mock_buzzer_.MakeBuzz("hello");
  auto buzz2 = mock_buzzer_.MakeBuzz("hello");
  EXPECT_NE(buzz1, nullptr);
  EXPECT_NE(buzz2, nullptr);
  EXPECT_NE(buzz1, buzz2);

  // Resets the default action for return type std::unique_ptr<Buzz>,
  // to avoid interfere with other tests.
  DefaultValue<std::unique_ptr<Buzz>>::Clear();
```

To customize the default action for a particular method of a specific mock
object, use [`ON_CALL`](reference/mocking.md#ON_CALL). `ON_CALL` has a similar
syntax to `EXPECT_CALL`, but it is used for setting default behaviors when you
do not require that the mock method is called. See
[Knowing When to Expect](gmock_cook_book.md#UseOnCall) for a more detailed
discussion.

## Setting Expectations {#ExpectCall}

See [`EXPECT_CALL`](reference/mocking.md#EXPECT_CALL) in the Mocking Reference.

## Matchers {#MatcherList}

See the [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers.md).

## Actions {#ActionList}

See the [Actions Reference](reference/actions.md).

## Cardinalities {#CardinalityList}

See the [`Times` clause](reference/mocking.md#EXPECT_CALL.Times) of
`EXPECT_CALL` in the Mocking Reference.

## Expectation Order

By default, expectations can be matched in *any* order. If some or all
expectations must be matched in a given order, you can use the
[`After` clause](reference/mocking.md#EXPECT_CALL.After) or
[`InSequence` clause](reference/mocking.md#EXPECT_CALL.InSequence) of
`EXPECT_CALL`, or use an [`InSequence` object](reference/mocking.md#InSequence).

## Distinguishing between Unintresting Calls from Different Mocks

By default unintresting mock function calls will be logged as function name and its address.
In case when multiple instances of same mocked class is used it can be useful to set mock name:
```cpp
Mock::SetMockName(&mock_obj, "NamedObject");
```

## Verifying and Resetting a Mock

gMock will verify the expectations on a mock object when it is destructed, or
you can do it earlier:

```cpp
using ::testing::Mock;
...
// Verifies and removes the expectations on mock_obj;
// returns true if and only if successful.
Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations(&mock_obj);
...
// Verifies and removes the expectations on mock_obj;
// also removes the default actions set by ON_CALL();
// returns true if and only if successful.
Mock::VerifyAndClear(&mock_obj);
```

Do not set new expectations after verifying and clearing a mock after its use.
Setting expectations after code that exercises the mock has undefined behavior.
See [Using Mocks in Tests](gmock_for_dummies.md#using-mocks-in-tests) for more
information.

You can also tell gMock that a mock object can be leaked and doesn't need to be
verified:

```cpp
Mock::AllowLeak(&mock_obj);
```

## Mock Classes

gMock defines a convenient mock class template

```cpp
class MockFunction<R(A1, ..., An)> {
 public:
  MOCK_METHOD(R, Call, (A1, ..., An));
};
```

See this [recipe](gmock_cook_book.md#UsingCheckPoints) for one application of
it.
