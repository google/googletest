This directory contains a copy of Google Test for use by users of
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.

This copy contains code specific to VC 6 that we don't intend to
integrate back to the trunk, as we want to keep the code there clean.

This copy is *not* supported by the Google Test team.  If you see a
bug, you are welcome to submit a patch to fix it yourself.  Read
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/GoogleTestDevGuide for
details.
